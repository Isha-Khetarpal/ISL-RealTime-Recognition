## **ISL Real-Time Recognition**  
🚀 **Indian Sign Language Recognition using CNN**  

This project implements a **real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) recognition system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. It aims to bridge the communication gap for the deaf community by accurately recognizing and translating ISL gestures.  

---

### **Features**  
✅ Real-time hand gesture recognition 📷  
✅ Built using **CNN** for accurate predictions  
✅ Supports multiple ISL gestures  
✅ Open for contributions to build a web interface! 🚀  

---

### **Tech Stack**  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **OpenCV** for image processing  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for training the CNN model  

💡 *Feel free to build a web interface for this project! Contributions are welcome!*  

---

### **How to Use?**  
1️⃣ **Upload an image/video** containing an ISL gesture  
2️⃣ **The trained CNN model** processes the input  
3️⃣ **Output**: The system identifies and translates the sign

### **Installation**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Isha-Khetarpal/ISL-RealTime-Recognition.git
cd ISL-RealTime-Recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py  # Run the recognition script
```

---

### **Dataset & Training**  
- The model was trained on an ISL dataset containing various hand gestures.  
- Data augmentation techniques were used to improve generalization.  
- Achieved **high accuracy** in recognizing multiple signs.
